# Reverse Image Sequence
This tool reverses the order of an image sequence. It changes the name ordering like so:

| Before | After |
| :-: |:-:|
| imgseq_0000.jpg | imgseq_0004.jpg |
| imgseq_0001.jpg | imgseq_0003.jpg |
| imgseq_0002.jpg | imgseq_0002.jpg |
| imgseq_0003.jpg | imgseq_0001.jpg |
| imgseq_0004.jpg | imgseq_0004.jpg |
### Goal
I made this tool so I can import a reversed image sequence directly into After Effects. Image sequences can be reversed inside of AE but the program handles the footage very poorly when it becomes pre-comped. Directly importing the sequence will make the editing process easier.

### Instructions
Make sure Python 3 is installed. Simply put imgseqrev.py inside the image sequence folder and run it from there.
